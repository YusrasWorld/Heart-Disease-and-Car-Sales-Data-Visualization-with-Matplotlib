# Heart-Disease-and-Car-Sales-Data-Visualization-with-Matplotlib


This project contains data visualization exercises using Matplotlib, focusing on two datasets:

Heart Disease Dataset: Visualizes cholesterol levels (chol), maximum heart rate achieved (thalach), and target class (presence/absence of heart disease). Includes scatter plots with color grouping, mean lines, and basic EDA.

Car Sales Dataset: Cleans and visualizes price and odometer readings. Includes scatter plots and data cleaning techniques (removing non-numeric characters, handling missing values).

This notebook demonstrates beginner-friendly use of Matplotlib for exploring real-world datasets and drawing insights through simple plots and annotations.
